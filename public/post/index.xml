      <description>I have not enough time. At least not enough time to realize all the ideas I have. And every week or so there are coming new ones joining the others on a huge pile of forgotten projects. The huge problem I have with this situation is, that I never know whether it would have been worth to spend more time thinking on or even realizing an idea. Not mentioning all the fun working on these projects I let slip through my fingers.</description>
