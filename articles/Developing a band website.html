You don't know us? Interesting I thought we would be internationally accepted. Seems like we have to work on our online present.
Our website is quite obsolete and buggy. The last entry is already more then a year ago and even our <a href="https://de-de.facebook.com/ThePaleAles/"> facebook</a> like
counter does not display the correct number. To put it in a nutshell, we could either update our website or let it vanish
from the open spaces of the internet.
<br>
<br> But as I'm already pretty busy with my day to day job, my girlfriend, family and smaller side projects I decided to
dive head first into the development of our new website. Cause finally I got absolutely no time for that so why should I
miss that opportunity!

<h2>The current state</h2>
The current website is hosted at <a href="http://strato.de">strato</a> and is basically nothing more than a simple wordpress
page. The only changes I made consist of the insertion of our logo and the creation of a contact form.

The whole page is written in Php and has a total size of about <b>64 mb</b>. When accessed for the first time it takes about <b>14.8 seconds</b> to download all the sources 
which adds up to more then <b>3.5 mb</b> of data. After all wordpress provides a full grown CMS to create and update posts, create user groups and
administrate the comment section. This can be quite awesome if the purpose of your website is to publish Blog posts regulary and develop a active discussion with your audience.
But this seems not to be the case for a simple band.
