title: "6 Bullets"

Recently I listened to a [podcast][1] of the Tim Ferris Show. In about an hour of
talking Tim revisits his book the [The 4-Hour Work Week][2]. To be honest I never read his book but there was some advice in this podcast eposiode which got stuck in my head.
Tim admits that he was also getting lost within all his side projects and organizing his life. So a good friend of him suggested that he should try a thought exercise. This goes as the following.

> *Imagine you have 6 bullets. This is all you got for the next two years. 6 Bullets in a revolver. You have 6 things that you can take seriously and do very publicly, thats it. Pick those 6 things very wisely.*

So I think I want to try that. As this blog is all about having no time it's no secret that I am really shitty at time management or bringing projects to an end. But what is a project or idea worth when not brought to completion? In this blog post I will collect some possible ideas, projects, lifegoals that could become the target of my 6 bullets. In the ongoing weeks I want to clearify for myself which goals are worh to proceed and pick 4 to take seriously. Why only 4 you may ask. It imposes it to me that if you have only 6 shots for 2 years it wouldn't be smart to give every bullet a target upfront. Circumstances may change and attention will be demanded in different life areas. Facing such changes unarmed just doesn't seem the right thing to do.

## My possible targets

Every possible target has a brief description. Just enough to not forget what it was all about. I also want to think about the possible impact of each target on my life. This will make it easier to pick 4 in a following blog post.

### 1. Learning the spanish language
I already had a spanish course in college but stopped visiting classes after the second lecture. But still, spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the world. It would be great to speak spanish just good enough to make oneself understood. This means having a conversation about the weather, asking for directions or reading a spanish newspaper should be possible without to much of a hussle. Speaking another language than german and englisch could reduce my travel shyness and open new travel destinations. It is also proven that [learning a new language has a positive impact on your brain][3]. Also it could potentially lead to getting to know new people and getting of a few hours from my computer.

### 2. Programming a 2D game
When I graduated I really wanted to make a game. Back then I had no idea what a task it is to create even a simple 2D side scroller. Since then I never really made an effort to create my own game. I only participated in [Ludum Dare][4] once. [This][5] was my entry. 

But as my employer recently hosted a hackathon and I was partially in charge of the organization the topic became naturally some kind of game programming.
The attendees had to write algorithms to control a bot on a 2D grid and make it solve puzzles, such as finding the exit or destroying as much competitors as possible. To keep the interface simple we decided to display the map as simple ascii characters. Since ascii characters do not make a really beautiful visualization of a game on their own it was my task to make it look better. So I created a [visualization][6] that uses WebGL to draw an actual pixel tile for every ascii character. In the beginning I had problems to get familiar to WebGL but I had some helping hands by one of my colleagues (who by the way wrote the [game server][7] for the hackathon).
But as I proceeded it became more and more fun and my long drowsing wish to create my own game reignited.

So this is where this target comes from. I have a lot of potential game ideas but I want to focus on a single one. My most favourite game of all time is probably World of Warcraft(WoW). I played it alot when I was in high school and have some great memories of this time. The part of the game which thrilled me the most was Player vs. Player(PvP). So my game should also be a pure PvP game where enter the arena and fight with a partner against one or more opposing teams. For the setting I have three possible topics. The first is fantasy like in Wow itself. The second one is some kind of gladiator fights inspired by the tv series [Spartacus][8]. And last but not least an archangel inspired setting with protagonists seen in the tv series [Lucifer][9].

The benefits of creating a game would be an improved knowledge in graphic programming which coincidentally is somehow helpfull for my work at my employer. It is also a chance to improve my design work. I really enjoy creating visuals and would love to make tangible progress.

But this target can also be really time consuming. Right now I'm not sure if I would use an existong engine or try to write my own. So developing this game vould devour to much time and reduce the changes to reach my other targets.

### 3. Making music with my band
I'm a member of a band called [The Pale Ales][10]. I do not even remember how long we already exist but this band and my bandmates accompany my life for quite some time. Even if we are covering songs most of the time I'm really proud of the way we arrange songs and make them sound completly different then the original track. So why is ***Making music with my band*** a target if it actually exists already? Our music ensemble suffers of two major problems. First nearly all of our bandmates are living in different citys within germany so it's pretty hard to find a date where all of us are free and can meet up. Second and more important the tasks for arranging and practicing a new song are not evenly spread accross all members of the band. We all are really good friends and really make an effort to make this band work but most of the work is actually done by only 3 people. I would not number myself among these 3 people. And this is what this target is all about.

I would like to get more active within my band. Composing new songs organizing gigs and simply be more willing to take action. Therefore I have to get better at any of the following instruments: guitar, piano, violine or the cajone. I also have to do more work alone to make our rehearsals more productive. 
Making music is a long lasting passion for me and there is nothing more fun then sharing this passion with my bandmates. This target would also improve friendship and my instrumental skills overall.

### 4. Really learning the piano
Recently I've got an electric piano. It was a wish of mine for my birthday and successful graduation which my mother happily fullfilled (Tank you mom). I wanted this piano in the first place because I often have to play a keyboard instrument for my band so I thought it would be nice to practice a bit. By now I can only play chords along a few songs such as Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen or Happier by Ed Sheeran. So this takes mostly the same path as my guitar skills. I teached myself to play the guitar in a really basic manner and never got good at the more advanced techniques like picking or playing extensive baree chords. 
It would be a shame if I would do the same with my piano. This is why I'm thinking of taking actual piano lessons. Which kind of lessons is not determined by now but it could be anything from classical to jazz piano.

Playing the piano professionally would improve my understanding of the way music is played and arranged. As you can play multiple tracks simultaniously the piano is great for creating new melodies and supporting parts. Plugin the electric piano into my computer I can also use the keyboard as any instrument I can imagine using the midi controller. This target could be important for my own musical development as it could be suportive for my target ***Making music with my band***. 

### 5. Try to create an internet presence
This target is somehow already in progress as I'm writing this blog post. But I'm still not sure where I wan't to go or what I expect from this. So mostly I want to write for myself as I'm becoming older and gain more experience as a developer. You can think of it as some kind of diary. But also I would like to share and discuss my thoughts with others. I really like to be publicly about what I'm doing and I like to be in a conversation with people. Somehow this has been always easier if you have something to tell about yourself. 

This is not my first time creating something in the internet. Back when I was in highschool I started together with my classmate Thomas a game and tool blog called gogools – fun fact my mother thought I would do something nasty as she associated go-go dancing with the site title. Actually we were writing about our favourite tools to record and edit videos on windows and our most beloved video games. It didn't take long that some other classmates asked if they could participate and write some articles aswell. This felt really great! Even if only one of these people actually sent in an article it was still awesome to know that people read our stuff and liked what we were doing. The euphoria did last about a year before we stopped writing for our blog.

It was time to play around with a different kind of media, video.

### 6. Give a talk to strangers

### 7. Making an effort to handle my finances
