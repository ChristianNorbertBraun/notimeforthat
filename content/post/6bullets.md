Recently I listened to a [podcast][1] of the Tim Ferris Show. In about an hour of
talking Tim revisits his book the [The 4-Hour Work Week][2]. To be honest I never read his book but there was some advice in this podcast eposiode which got stuck in my head.
Tim admits that he was also getting lost within all his side projects and organizing his life. So a good friend of him suggested that he should try a thought exercise. This goes as the following.

> *Imagine you have 6 bullets. This is all you got for the next two years. 6 Bullets in a revolver. You have 6 things that you can take seriously and do very publicly, thats it. Pick those 6 things very wisely.*

So I think I want to try that. As this blog is all about having no time it's no secret that I am really shitty at time management or bringing projects to an end. But what is a project or idea worth when not brought to completion? In this blog post I will collect some possible ideas, projects, lifegoals that could become the target of my 6 bullets. In the ongoing weeks I want to clearify for myself which goals are worh to proceed and pick 4 to take seriously. Why only 4 you may ask. It imposes it to me that if you have only 6 shots for 2 years it wouldn't be smart to give every bullet a target upfront. Circumstances may change and attention will be demanded in different life areas. Facing such changes unarmed just doesn't seem the right thing to do.

## My possible targets

Every possible target has a brief description. Just enough to not forget what it was all about. I also want to think about the possible impact of each target on my life. This will make it easier to pick 4 in a following blog post.

### 1. Learning the spanish language
I already had a spanish course in college but stopped visiting classes after the second lecture. But still, spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the world. It would be great to speak spanish just good enough to make oneself understood. This means having a conversation about the weather, asking for directions or reading a spanish newspaper should be possible without to much of a hussle. Speaking another language that german and englisch could reduce my travel shyness and open new travel destinations. It is also proven that [learning a new language has a positive impact on your brain][3].
